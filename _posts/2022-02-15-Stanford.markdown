excerpt: I'll be based at Stanford from Summer 2022.
---

I'm really excited to share that, starting Summer 2022, I'll be based at Stanford as a
pre-doctoral fellow in economics. My time will be split between working for
[Shoshana Vasserman](https://shoshanavasserman.com/) and
[Claudia Allende](https://www.claudiaallendesc.com/) (both at the GSB) and taking
classes. In the medium term, I'll be applying to doctoral programs in economics.

I'm grateful for the most recent chapter in Berlin (a chapter whose ending has yet to be
written), and I plan to take all the lessons I've learned from wise colleagues and
friends in industry with me. I'm also extremely grateful to Shosh and Claudia for the
opportunity to learn from them, to be a student again and return to my interests in the
social sciences, and — last but not least — to get more sunshine.

When the time comes, say hi if you're in the Bay Area.
