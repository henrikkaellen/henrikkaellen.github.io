# About

Hi! I'm Henrik.

I'm a senior at Yale University studying Computer Science & Economics. I'm interested in all things data analytics related. Please check out my projects below.

Previously, I worked under the Data Science & Analytics Head Intern at [Frever](https://frever.com/), developing ... Before that, I was a Data Science Intern at Tetra Pak.

I'm originally from ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. Outside of work, some of the things I get excited about are cinematogrophy, the outdoors,
and house music.
