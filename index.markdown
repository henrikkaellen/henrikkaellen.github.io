# About

Hi! :wave: I'm Ben.

I'm currently a predoctoral fellow in economics at Stanford, working most closely with [Claudia Allende](https://www.claudiaallendesc.com/) and [Shoshana Vasserman](https://shoshanavasserman.com/).

Previously, I was at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), developing quantitative solutions to problems in industry. Still before that, I completed a master's
degree in statistics at Oxford, and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at
Harvard.

I'm originally from :uk:, :de: and :fr:. Outside of work, some of the things I get excited about are architecture, the outdoors,
and electronica.
